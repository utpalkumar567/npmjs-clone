## Code Structure

The codebase is organized into several key components:

- **`src/`**: Main source directory containing all the React components and assets.
  - **`components/`**: Contains reusable components (e.g., SearchBar, PackageList).
  - **`pages/`**: Contains main page components (e.g., Home, PackageDetail).
  - **`App.js`**: Main application file that sets up routing and renders components.
  - **`index.js`**: Entry point of the application.
  
- **`public/`**: Contains static files like `index.html`.

- **`package.json`**: Lists project dependencies and scripts.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **React Router**: For handling routing between pages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components.
- **npm**: For package management.
